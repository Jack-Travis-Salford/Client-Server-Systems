# Client-Server-Systems
Salford University Year 2 - Client Server Systems.

This a website I made in the 2nd year of University. It is a responsive website, utilizing the Bootstap framework, created using the MVC design pattern. 

The premise of the website is a location sharing site that allowing you to see the location of your friends (other users of the site that a friend request has been sent to and confirmed by the other user) in real time, provided they are logged into the website and have enabled location sharing in their browser. 

The website utilizes Cookies and a database for user data, allowing them to log in, view information about themselves and others, see the location of their friends on a map and search for other users. 

The Mapbox api was used to display the map and added markers.

Please note that database information and the Mapbox api key have been redacted from this upload.

I am currently working on hosting this and my 1st year website. A link to it will be provided in this repo if/when that happens.

Sample login information for one of the users:
